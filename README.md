FizzBuzz Freestanding Edition
==============================

[FizzBuzz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fizz_buzz) is a common interview question for computer programmers. Creating a list of the first 100 Fizz buzz numbers is a trivial problem for any would-be computer programmer, so interviewers can easily sort out those with insufficient programming ability. -- Wikipedia.

[Freestanding](http://wiki.osdev.org/C_Library#Freestanding_and_Hosted) is a C compilation environment where only a few headers are usable that contains only defines and types. Usually program is compiled in hosted environment, which is meant for user-space programming while freestanding is meant for kernel programming.

Freestanding program runs without operating system, therefore it can not do system call. Actually, the program itself is the only running program in the machine.

## How to run

1. Download the [latest iso](https://github.com/andylibrian/fizzbuzz-freestanding-edition/releases)
2. Run the iso on virtual box, qemu, or other virtual machine. Or you can even burn the iso to USB disk and boot your PC with it.

## But, why?

- Because you are screening for software engineers?
- We believe simplicity is a key in software engineering. So we wanted FizzBuzz to be as lean as possible. [The existing FizzBuzz implementation](https://github.com/EnterpriseQualityCoding/FizzBuzzEnterpriseEdition) is bloated. We don't need all that complexity to just print Fizz and Buzz. We don't even need an Operating System to do that.
