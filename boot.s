    # Welcome to kernel mode! We now have sufficient code for the bootloader to
    # load and run our operating system. It doesn't do anything interesting yet.
    # Perhaps we would like to call printf("Hello, World\n"). You should now
    # realize one of the profound truths about kernel mode: There is nothing
    # there unless you provide it yourself. There is no printf function. There
    # is no <stdio.h> header. If you want a function, you will have to code it
    # yourself. And that is one of the best things about kernel development:
    # you get to make the entire system yourself. You have absolute and complete
    # power over the machine, there are no security restrictions, no safe
    # guards, no debugging mechanisms, there is nothing but what you build.

    # By now, you are perhaps tired of assembly language. You realize some
    # things simply cannot be done in C, such as making the multiboot header in
    # the right section and setting up the stack. However, you would like to
    # write the operating system in a higher level language, such as C or C++.
    # To that end, the next task is preparing the processor for execution of
    # such code. C doesn't expect much at this point and we only need to set up
    # a stack. Note that the processor is not fully initialized yet and stuff
    # such as floating point instructions are not available yet.

    # To set up a stack, we simply set the esp register to point to the top of
    # our stack (as it grows downwards).

    # We are now ready to actually execute C code. We cannot embed that in an
    # assembly file, so we'll create a kernel.c file in a moment. In that file,
    # we'll create a C entry point called kernel_main and call it here.
    call kernel_main

    # In case the function returns, we'll want to put the computer into an
    # infinite loop. To do that, we use the clear interrupt ('cli') instruction
    # to disable interrupts, the halt instruction ('hlt') to stop the CPU until
    # the next interrupt arrives, and jumping to the halt instruction if it ever
    # continues execution, just to be safe. We will create a local label rather
    # than real symbol and jump to there endlessly.
